          Living by the principle "Viam supervadet vadens" - "He who walks will overcome the road!", as my mother told
          me, and when I took my first steps together with my father, from childhood I had become more and more sure
          that nothing is unattainable for a Person.

          In the yard and on the sports field, I was always in the top three, among those who led the teams. After my
          parents sent me to school (majoring in computer science) at the age of 6, I was interested in new subjects every
          year, participated and took places in local inter school Olympiads in mathematics (VI), physics (II), chemistry (III),
          foreign language (English), world literature.
          In the higher school (at the electrification department) I was the second headman, received an increased
          scholarship, graduated with a diploma with honors. At the university (green energy major, physics faculty), I was
          one of three in the group who was awarded an increased scholarship.

          When I was a seller, I increased the sales and rating of the store. When I was a self-employed electrician, people
          knew me and recommended my services to their friends. When I was a call manager, the "most difficult"
          customers were referred to me. When I worked at the factory, I was the second specialist after the foreman.
          When I worked at a car service, on my own I turned a "seasonal business" into a stable business spot, where
          people came to me for service by appointment.
